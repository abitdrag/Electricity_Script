# Electricity_Script
A teeny-tiny script to know about electricity bill amount of your neighbors and more!!

It is an extremely simple Python script with less than 10 lines of code. It fetches the electricity bill amount from TSSPDCL (Southern Power Distribution Company of Telengana state, India). It will display username and bill amount for that user. The user IDs are enumerated in given range!!   
Change the range in for loop to see more users. 

EDIT: After I developed the script and ran it a few times, TSSPDCL decided to put Captcha.
I hope I can take out time some day to create script that can auto-fill captcha.
